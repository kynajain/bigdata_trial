Say, can you hear?
Is there a meaning to your grief?
Where there is pain you see grace
As if sacrifice was a meaningful end in itself
Your trial and error is error and error

Staying at the end of a hallway
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision, you’re the scapegoat
Try to fix things that have never been broken

You’re self-absorbed
Raving about your cryptic ways
Aren’t willing to change
Old grudges
Hoping for your turn
All the basement stories you heard
Waiting for the world
To bend around you

Staying at the end of a hallway
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision, you’re the scapegoat
Try to fix things that have never been broken

Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision, you’re the scapegoat
Try to fix things that have never been broken6Embed

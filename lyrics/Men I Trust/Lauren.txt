There’s a voice I always trust
Its friendly helping hand tells me leave, I must
Cause I can’t stay forever, (a-a-a-a)
Cause I can't stay forever, (a-a-a-a)
By my window

(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a)
(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a)
Cause I can’t stay forever
Cause I can’t stay forever
(A-a-a, a-a-a, a-a-a)

Rather chase a gentle breeze
Set my thoughts by taller trees
Cause I can’t stay forever, (a-a-a-a)
Cause I can't stay forever, (a-a-a-a)
By my window

(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a)
(A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a)
Cause I can’t stay forever
Cause I can’t stay forever
(A-a-a, a-a-a, a-a-a)

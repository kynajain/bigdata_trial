In the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire
Fire
He’d never done that with a lover before
Before
Meanwhile everyone else got lost in quiet
By the river
Seeking for more, of course he found better

He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood

In the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire
Fire
He’d never done that with a lover before
Before
He was seeking for more
Either early or too late, it was number seven
And it happened
High like a bird with his beak through the window
You might also like
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood

He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going

He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more

Let’s lay down our masks
And be true
So that our eyes
Be bound in affection
Aware of our lust
And our shared trust
We can know each other
And hear nature’s words
My dear friend

But let’s not talk this through (I used to)
Cause long words widen gaps between lovers
We ought to be lone, my home’s your own
Until we have each other we’re strangers

I know there’s a reason
We use such curves
Riddles in smiles
Rather than small talk
I know we both want
Things to be done
In a truthful manner
There lies our rest
My dear friend

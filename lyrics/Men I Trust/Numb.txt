Hon', please forgive me if I ever did you wrong
I'll be your candle, burn me upside down
From now on, I won't sleep on my arms
Numb, is how I feel deep inside my soul
Need to feel that I am on the line
I'm sorry that I dragged you down my way

Hon', I never meant to cheat you out of time
In cold mornings when our sheets are warm
I see a flower with no needles on (So far)
Stung, and there's a bee that gave it all away
Pretty eyes now filled with pain
A young confusion, what a shameYou might also like10Embed

I’m happy as I am
Cause I’m leaving
Days will be the same
In a different way

Going to a place
Where I used to stay
Writing something new
In this home I know

We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won’t die in the city

Right eyelids closed
Both feet behind
I aim for tomorrow
Work on my mind

Going to a place
Where I used to stay
Writing something new
In this home I know

We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won’t die in the city
We’ll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won’t die in the city7Embed

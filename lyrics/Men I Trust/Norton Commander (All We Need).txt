My friend, you know you had your time a while
But I'm willing to give you mine
Few things we both have keep us alive
My life and our true love is all we need

All we need
It's all we need
It's all we need

I don't want to feel a world against our love
I don't want to grow old alone and broken heart

We need
It's all we need
It's all we need
It's all we need
All we need
All we need
All we needYou might also like1Embed

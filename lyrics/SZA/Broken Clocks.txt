Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a paycheck
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No, you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was ten
Love dirty men alike

Ooh
Better day than yesterday (Keep cuttin' up)
Ooh
I just take it day by day
Ooh, oh
Never hearing what they say (Uh)
Ooh-ooh (Mm)
I just do it my way

All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love (Still love), still love
It's still love, it's still love
Nothin' but love for you (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love
You might also like
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talkin' a lot, sorry, I'm faded (Turnin' up real good tonight)
Think I forgot you love me (Think I forgot the other night)
You love me, you love me

Got a shift at 10 AM (Yeah)
Gotta dip at 10 PM (Nah)
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past a lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days, don't break (Ugh)
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talkin' 'bout me like we together?
I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever and then some
You gon' make me late to work again

Ooh
Better day than yesterday
Ooh
I just take it day by day
Ooh, oh
Never hearing what they say
Ooh-ooh
I just do it my way (Keep doin' it)
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love, still love (Still love)
It's still love, and it's still love (Still love)
Nothin' but love for you
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love

I don't eat, can't sleep past 9 AM
Heartbeat make me feel young again (Make me feel like aâ€”)
Can't beat 'em, just join the party (Let me join the party)
I don't wanna, don't need nobody

All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talkin' a lot, sorry, I'm faded
Think I forgot you love me
You love me, you love me

You love me
You love me
You love me73Embed

Need you for the old me, need you for my sanity
Need you to remind me where I come from
Can you remind me of my gravity?
Ground me when I'm tumblin', spiralin', plummetin' down to Earth
You keep me down to Earth
Call me on my bullshit
Lie to me and say my booty gettin' bigger even if it ain't
Love me even if it rain
Love me even if it pain you
I know I be difficult (Right)
You know I be difficult (Right)
You know it get difficult to

Open your heart up
Hopin' I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me, but I
Believe you when you say it like that (Say it like that)
Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that? (Say it like that)
Oh, I believe you when you say it like that (Say it like that)
You must really love me
You might also like
For real, I'm not playing no games
Boy, we're back and forth
I need your support now (Now, now, now, now, now)
In case you call my phone one more 'gain
Got no panties on
I need your support now (Now, now, now, now, now)
I know you'd rather be laid up with a big booty
Probably hella positive 'cause she got a big booty (Wow)
I know I'd rather be paid up
You know I'm sensitive 'bout havin' no booty
Havin' nobody, only you, buddy
Can you hold me when nobody's around us?

Open your heart up
Hopin' I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me, but I
Believe you when you say it like that (Say it like that)
Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that? (Say it like that)
Oh, I believe you when you say it like that (Say it like that)
You must really love me
(Heart up)
(Never find out that you're—)
(Heart up)
(Heart up)
(Never find out that you're—)

You don't have shit to say to me, I ain't got shit to say to you
(And that's the truth)
And step, and step on
Also you Black heffa, yeah, you, you stand your ground
'Cause I, I feel the same way
If you don't like me, you don't have to fool with me
But you don't have to talk about me or treat me mean
I don't have to treat you mean
I just stay out of your way
That's the way we work that one51Embed
